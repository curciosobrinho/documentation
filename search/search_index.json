authentication that does not require user action within the PingOne DaVinci flow. </p> <p>MagicEndpoint is based on the principle that the endpoint can perform public key-based authentication that no other device or bad actor can duplicate. Leveraging this inherent capability within endpoint devices significantly reduces the attack surface. The breakthrough behind MagicEndpoint's technology means a client only has to authenticate to the endpoint to verify they are in possession of the device, and the endpoint can do the remote authentication on behalf of the user, with no user action required. MagicEndpoint does not need phones or external tokens. Smarter, faster passwordless authentication means no more obtaining codes from mobile devices, or accepting insecure \"push\" notifications, or re-setting multiple passwords. </p> <p>The result? With the MagicEndpoint connector, CIOs and CISOs can be confident their employees and data are protected while reducing and eventually eliminating the need for password support.</p>"},{"location":"winmagic/#setup","title":"Setup","text":""},{"location":"winmagic/#resources","title":"Resources","text":"<p>In DaVinci, add a MagicEndpoint connection in the flow when authentication is required.</p> <p>Configure MagicEndpoint IdP OIDC Service Providers: * How to configure MagicEndpoint IdP OIDC Service Providers</p> <p>MagicEndpoint IdP: * MagicEndpoint Enterprise Authentication</p>"},{"location":"winmagic/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>To use the connector, you\u2019ll need:</p> <ol> <li>SecureDoc Enterprise Server and MagicEndpoint IdP installed</li> <li>A MagicEndpoint license</li> <li>MagicEndpoint Windows Client installed on the endpoint </li> <li>MagicEndpoint Authenticator (for Out of Band Support) on mobile devices (iOS and Android)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"winmagic/#setting-up-magicendpoint-idp","title":"Setting up MagicEndpoint IdP","text":"<ol> <li>Obtain MagicEndpoint \u2013 OIDC URL settings:</li> </ol> <p>Admin can login to MagicEndpoint IdP web portal and obtain OIDC URLs from Configuration -&gt; OIDC </p> <ol> <li>Add Service Provider \u2013 PingOne: </li> <li>Admin can add an OIDC service provider by clicking on \"+ Add Service Provider\" on Configuration -&gt; OIDC</li> <li>Service Provider (SP) Name: PingOne</li> <li>Client Name: PingOne</li> <li>Redirect URL: Obtain from PingOne console</li> <li>Client Secret: * Enter a new secret *</li> <li>Session exp.
