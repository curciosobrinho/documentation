  - Sign up for an account [here](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup)
- You must have a valid API key in order to make any calls to the Mailgun API.
  - Find your Mailgun API key [here](https://app.mailgun.com/app/account/security/api_keys)

## Setting up the connector

#### Mailgun Connector General Settings:

- Navigate to the Mailgun connector via the _**Connections**_ tab in DaVinci.
- Select _**New Connection**_ in the upper right-hand corner.
- Search for the desired connector (in this case, Mailgun).
- Select the Mailgun connector.
- Once the Mailgun connector has been added the _**Your Connections**_ list, click on the connector.
- From here you will see three text fields labeled **Domain**, **API Key**, and **API Version**.
  - **Domain**:
    - This text field is for your custom Mailgun domain.
      - E.g. `DOMAIN_NAME.mailgun.org`
      - To create/verify your own custom domain follow the steps provided [here](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/203637190-How-Do-I-Add-or-Delete-a-Domain-)
  - **Mailgun API Key**:
    - Before pasting your API key into the text field you must first base64 encode the key with 'api'
      - E.g. `echo -n 'api:qnbxdMY444lF2gwM3fDx'| base64` = `YXBpOnFuYnhkTVk0NDRsRjJnd00zZkR4`
        - The above command is for the Mac Terminal
    - Copy and paste your base64 encoded API Key into the text field.
  - **Mailgun API Version**:
    - This field will already be filled out.
      - Only change this if the API version is out of date.
